                            <td>Both use grid layout for easy product scanning. Amazon includes social proof (ratings/reviews) which we omitted for simplicity and to reduce backend complexity. Both prominently display discounts to encourage purchases, following proven e-commerce conversion principles.</td>

                            <td>Both use nature-inspired colors to reinforce eco-friendly brand identity. Their minimalist approach influenced our clean, uncluttered design.

                            <td>Both implement form validation to ensure data quality. EarthHero's multi-step approach reduces form abandonment but increases complexity. Our simpler single-page form is more straightforward for a smaller site and easier to implement at beginner level while still providing essential functionality.</td>

                            <td>Amazon's footer serves as a comprehensive sitemap for their vast platform. Our minimal footer provides necessary information without overwhelming users, appropriate for a smaller e-commerce site. Both approaches are context-appropriate for their respective scales and user needs.</td>

                            <td>Web-safe sans-serif fonts (Arial or Helvetica), consistent heading hierarchy (h1, h2, h3), adequate line-height for easy reading</td>
                            <td>Both prioritize readability with sans-serif fonts. Etsy uses custom fonts for brand identity but requires additional loading time. Our web-safe fonts ensure universal compatibility and fast loading without external font files, keeping code simple and accessible across all devices and browsers.</td>

                        <li><strong>Simplified Navigation:</strong> Our streamlined navigation reduces cognitive load compared to Amazon's complex mega-menus, making it appropriate for our focused product range and beginner-friendly implementation.</li>
                        <li><strong>Essential Product Information:</strong> We prioritize key decision-making factors (price, eco-benefits, basic features) over social proof elements like reviews, reducing backend complexity while maintaining conversion potential.</li>
                        <li><strong>Educational Focus:</strong> Unlike commercial sites focused purely on sales, our blog and research sections add educational value, aligning with our sustainability mission and academic project requirements.</li>
                        <li><strong>Accessibility Foundation:</strong> While not implementing advanced features like EarthHero's font adjustment tools, we ensure basic accessibility through semantic HTML, alt text, and color contrast compliance.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Technical Implementation Learnings</h3>

                        <li><strong>Form Validation:</strong> Client-side validation is universally implemented, supporting our decision to include JavaScript validation for contact form.</li>
                        <li><strong>Color Psychology:</strong> Successful eco-commerce sites consistently use green and earth tones, validating our color scheme choices for brand alignment.</li>
